<b>Introduction to Programming</b>
 
  <p>Programming is the act of inputting literal and exact command instructions to a computer and expecting a certain output result. Therefore, programmers must constantly and systematically debug their work before being able to implement the correct results. This webpage is crafted as a project to complete my  nanodegree from 
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/me#!/">Udacity</a>
   .By utilizing Andy Brown's 
    <a href="Codepen.io">Codepen</a>
   , I can use this tool to implement my goal to practice, learn, document, and teach this course simultaneously.</p> 
<b>The Web: the HTML Network</b>
 <p>The 
    <em>Internet</em> 
    is the biggest, largest, most public and pervelent computer network on Earth. Users of the Internet use their browsers to request HTML documents to be sent to them and loaded on their computers. Servers on the Internet utilize their powerful processing capabilities to respond to these high volumes of requests by sending them the specifically requested HTML documents.
 </p>
<b>HTML Documents: What the Web is made of</b>
 <p>Hyper Text Markup Language is a language that developers use to create HTML documents so that client browsers can display them to the user whenever she downloads those pages from an HTTP server hosting the documents. They're made of texts & markups. Markups decide what the different texts should look like.</p>
<b>An HTML Document's Anatomy: Tags & Elements</b>
<p>An HTML document is made up of <b><em>tags</em></b> and <b><em>elements</em></b>. Tags make up the elements. Elements can have either one tag (Void elements) or two tags. The way these tags and elements are constructed determine how the computer understands and thus executes your code to a desired and correct output</p>
<b>Blocks vs Inlines</b>
 <p><b><em>Blocks</em></b> are elements that come in a form of an "invisible box" that comes after the line where the block element is written. On the contrary, <b><em>Inlines</em></b>  are elements that don't have an invisible box after the written inline element; they remain in line.</p>
<b>Are Computers Stupid?</b>
 <p>Although computers can't literally be told how to seperate odd and even numbers from a list of thousand numbers like humans could, they most definitely will execute that request rather much faster than humans. The difference is that you can tell a human to "divide these numbers into an odd-and-even order," and she will painstakingly do the task after long hours, and possibly days of repetitive work, however, the programmer takes her time to code up an application, or a function within an app that's made to use abstractions and other techniques to sort out these two groups of separate numbers. </p>
 <p> Thus I believe that computers are <b>not</b> <em>stupid</em> ironically, since it's the human programmer who programs the application and the user who uses it; both the programmer and user must build and utilize the program exactly the way it should work, so that the computer can understand and run the codes and commands it's being fed and ran into.
